# Conway's Game of Life with Pygame

This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Pygame, a popular Python library for creating games and multimedia applications. The project serves as an opportunity to deepen understanding of Python concepts like object-oriented programming (OOP) and to explore the basics of the Pygame framework.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/game-of-life.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## To Run

To run the game, execute the following command:

```bash
  python main.py
```


## About Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The game is a classic example of emergent behavior, where complex patterns arise from simple rules.
